                                Itâ€™s super easy, once you sign up for an account you will verify you bank account through our secure service. Invite your tenant to sign up for a tenant account, once they verify their account they will be able to easily pay monthly invoices. Payments are setup to be reoccurring and automatically invoice the tenant each month, to include notifying them by email and text message.

                               Yes, we have a separate account just for landlords who do not directly manage their property. Easily provide payments to the landlord by having them sign up for an account at no cost. If you are a landlord who manages your property yourself, sign up for a Property Manager account and take advantage of all of our services.
