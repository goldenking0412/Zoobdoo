Your use of ZOOBDOO.COM signifies your acknowledgement of and agreement to these Terms of Use. </strong></p>

    <p><strong>1. ONLINE VENUE</strong></p>

    <p>1.1       <u>Online Venue</u>. ZOOBDOO.COM is an online venue ("Venue") allowing landlords and tenants to interact with each other, including paying and receiving rent and other services. Zoobdoo is not involved in the actual transactions between landlords and tenants or any other users. We do not own or manage, nor can we contract for, any of the properties listed on this site. Zoobdoo is not a landlord, real estate agent, or broker. Rather, Zoobdoo merely provides the venue for users, including landlords and tenants to interact. The actual lease and other transactions are directly between the landlords and tenants who use this site. We are not a party to any rental or other agreement between users. This is true even if you sign a lease using Zoobdoo or use one of Zoobdoo’s forms. While we may facilitate the signing of lease agreements or provide other tools, services or products, we are not a party to any rental or other agreements between users.</p>

    <p>1.2       <u>Local Laws and Regulations</u>. You agree that you are responsible for and agree to abide by all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you, including laws, rules, regulations or other requirements relating to taxes, credit cards, data and privacy, taxes, permits or license requirements, zoning ordinances, safety compliance and compliance with all anti-discrimination and fair housing laws. Each state and many local municipalities have unique rules and regulations concerning rental properties, landlords, tenants, and property managers. Nothing on this website constitutes legal advice and Zoobdoo makes no warranty that use of ZOOBDOO.COM or the forms or services offered by ZOOBDOO.COM is permissible under your local laws and regulations. The legal analysis of whether a particular lease provision or landlord practice is permissible in your area cannot be properly represented or accounted for on a web page. You are responsible for following all local laws and regulations, including those related to rental properties in your area. If you have a question about specific laws or regulations in your area, you should contact a local attorney who is authorized to practice in your sate and it familiar with the local laws applicable to you.</p>

    <p>1.3       <u>Payments</u>. By providing us with your banking or other payment information, you authorize us to use it and disclose it to our payment gateway providers for the purpose of processing payments. We never take custody of money you transfer, we cannot provide refunds, and we’re not responsible for what recipients do with the payments you make.</p>

    <p>1.4       <u>Credit Reports</u>. We are not a credit bureau or credit reporting agency and do not control the contents of credit reports, including reports obtained through ZOOBDOO.COM. If you believe that any information contained in your credit report is inaccurate or incomplete, you should dispute it directly with the credit reporting agency that issued the report.</p>

    <p>1.5       <u>No Control Over User Services</u>. Zoobdoo has no control over and does not guarantee: (a) the existence, quality, safety or legality of the services provided among users; (b) the rental properties advertised; (c) the truth or accuracy of users' content or listings; (d) the ability of landlords to actually rent a property; the ability of tenants to pay rent; or (e) that a landlord or tenant will actually complete a transaction or provide a service. All property listings on ZOOBDOO.COM are the sole responsibility of the user (who may be the owner or a property manager or duly authorized property manager or agent of the owner) and we specifically disclaim any and all liability arising from the alleged accuracy of the listings or any alleged breaches of contract on a user's part.</p>

    <p>1.6       <u>Legal Compliance</u>. You agree not to use the Venue to offer services which are illegal in Nevada, the United States, or in your local jurisdiction. By using the Venue, you agree to comply with all applicable domestic and international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations regarding your activity on ZOOBDOO.COM. In addition, you shall be responsible for paying any and all taxes applicable to any services offered through ZOOBDOO.COM.</p>

You further warrant that you are in compliance with Zoobdoo's published policies. You are responsible for reading the full item listing before completing a transaction. When you enter into an agreement with a landlord or tenant you are entering into a legally binding contract directly with the landlord or tenant, not with Zoobdoo.</p>

    <p>1.10     <u>Scams</u>. Use common sense when placing or responding to a listing through the Venue. Use the same common sense you would use in the real world when reading an ad. If it is too good to be true, it is a scam. For more information about various online scams and how to avoid them, go to http://OnGuardOnline.gov.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><strong>9. Governing Law / Disputes</strong></p>

    <p>9.1       You agree that the ZOOBDOO.COM website shall be deemed solely based in the State of Nevada.</p>

    <p>9.2       The ZOOBDOO.COM website shall be deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Zoobdoo, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Nevada.</p>

    <p>9.3       <u>Governing Law / Jurisdiction</u>. These Terms of Use will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Nevada applicable to agreements entered into and to be wholly performed therein, without regard to principles of conflict of laws. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use are governed by a mandatory arbitration clause set out below, however, if a court is necessary in whole or in part to enforce these Terms of Use, You consent and submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Clark County, Nevada and waive any objection to personal jurisdiction, to venue, or to convenience of forum.</p>

    <p>9.4       <u>Disputes</u>. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the ZOOBDOO.COM website, this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Las Vegas, Nevada, before one arbitrator. At the option of the first to commence an arbitration, the arbitration shall be administered either by JAMS pursuant to its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator may not award any consequential, indirect, exemplary, special or incidental damages arising from or relating to your use of the ZOOBDOO.COM website (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss). Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. You and we will each pay one-half of the costs and expenses of such arbitration, and each of the parties will separately pay their counsel fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>
